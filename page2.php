<h3>Reduces Stress and Anxiety for everyone<h3>

<p style="font-size:16px;">A hot stone massage is a type of massage therapy. Itâ€™s used to help you relax and ease tense muscles and damaged soft tissues throughout your body. 
During a hot stone massage, smooth, flat, heated stones are placed on specific parts of your body. The stones are usually made of basalt, a type of volcanic rock that retains heat. According to the University of New Hampshire Health Services, hot massage stones are heated to between 130 and 145 degrees.
